This repository contains code and data relevant to generating the database for training a wine-food pairing model.

I have explored 2 approaches: Rule-based and LLM-based. 
<li>
  <ul><b>Rule-based</b> uses pre-defined rules from wine theory and credible sources, with the advantage of being able to run independently without needing any API. However, I have found it to be less effective, less adaptable, and harder to maintain.</ul>
  <ul><b>LLM-based</b> takes advantage of existing LLMs to generate recommendations. This is the approach that Sanyam and I are currently implementing</ul>
</li>
